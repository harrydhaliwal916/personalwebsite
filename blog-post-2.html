        <h2>My From Sketch to Screen: My Portfolio Website Build</h2>
        <p>Building my portfolio website was more than just a coding project—it was a creative journey. I started with a simple sketch, mapping out how I wanted my site to look and function. From there, I brought it to life using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, refining each section to reflect my style and skills.</p>

            <p>One of the biggest challenges was balancing aesthetics with functionality. I wanted the site to look sleek while keeping navigation intuitive. Through trial and error, I adjusted layouts, tweaked animations, and ensured responsiveness across devices.</p>
            
            <p>Seeing my portfolio evolve from an idea to a fully functional website has been a rewarding experience. It’s not just a showcase of my work—it’s proof of my growth as a front-end developer. And the best part? This is just the beginning.</p>
