        <p>My Front-End Journey: From Curiosity to Crafting Web Experiences</p>

            <p>After years in marketing, I decided to pivot into front-end development. I first started learning front-end development, I had no idea how much I would enjoy bringing designs to life with code. It began as a curiosity, a desire to understand how websites were structured and styled. Now, after countless hours of learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I’ve built my own portfolio website from the ground up.</p>
            
            <p>Through trial, error, and perseverance, I’ve refined my design sensibilities, improved my coding efficiency, and embraced the process of iteration. Every tweak, every bug fix, and every design choice has been a lesson, making me more confident in my skills. My journey isn’t just about writing clean code; it’s about crafting intuitive, engaging experiences that users enjoy.</p>
            
            <p>As I continue refining my portfolio and expanding my skill set, I’m excited about what’s next—whether it’s mastering animations, learning React, or diving deeper into UX/UI principles. This journey has just begun, and I can’t wait to see where it takes me.</p>
